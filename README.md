# Formative Assessment 1: React Application for Data Visualisation with ChartJS

For car enthusiasts, researchers, and potential buyers who wish to examine and contrast vehicles using actual data, this project is a VIN-powered vehicle data explorer. Data is extracted to:

- Look up a car using its VIN

- Present technical details in a clear, engaging format.

- Examine two separate cars side by side.

- See a vehicle's historical model year timeline and MSRP trends.

It is intended for users who wish to research the historical development of automobiles or make well-informed decisions.

## Appendix

#### API Source
- This app uses the [Car API v2](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/car-api2) from RapidAPI to fetch vehicle data such as VIN details, trims, and specifications.
- Note: Non-paying users are limited to VINs from **2015â€“2020**.

#### Project Structure

```
/pages
  LandingPage.jsx         // VIN search and single vehicle data
  ComparisonPage.jsx      // Compare two vehicles
  TimelinePage.jsx        // Visual timeline of trims and MSRP

/styles
  LandingPage.module.css
  ComparisonPage.module.css
  TimelinePage.module.css
```

#### Test VINs to Try

- `1GTG6CEN0L1139305` (GMC Canyon 2020)
- `5UXKR0C5XF0K56785` (BMW X5 2015)
- `WVGZZZ7PZHD006123` (Volkswagen Touareg 2017)

#### Future Ideas

- Add user authentication and save vehicle history
- Export comparison results as PDF
- Add live exchange rate for MSRP conversion
- Add ability to search for Make and Model across all pages
